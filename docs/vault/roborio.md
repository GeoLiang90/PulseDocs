#roboRIO

When you flash the rio, you are essentially wiping it. Therefore, __you must reinstall things like java.__

Or you would have if you were on the team a few years ago. Installing Java is now a functionality handled by the WPILIB Eclipse Plugin. 

In order to reconfigure the radio, connect it to the laptop with a USB only, using the printer cables, and run the roboRIO imaging tool. For more detailed instructions, visit:
