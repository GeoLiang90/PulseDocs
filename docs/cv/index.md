# Computer Vision (CV)

_Let your robot see!_

Computer Vision (CV) can be as essential asset in the right game. In 2016 (Stronghold), CV was essential to our robot's functioning, with our robot able to see the goalpost, and use its position in the frame to align, scoring the boulders with very high accuracy, something which we used in TeleOp as well, much more efficient than our drive team. 

## Other CV resources

For more practice, visit our GitHub pages on CV Education for our members (examples + docs of library functions):

- [2017 Page](https://github.com/Team694/cv-edu-2017)
- [2018 Page](https://github.com/Team694/cv-edu-2018)

In addition to the documentation here on MkDocs, we have:

- [Team694/stuyvision-lib](https://github.com/Team694/stuyvision-lib),
  an in-house GUI to help with tuning.

- a few presentations by our members:
a [high-level talk](https://docs.google.com/a/stuypulse.com/presentation/d/1KvPWpPO9rFjTZ3nKJy4rmbvxRiOo2EwrciE0fggv8xM/edit?usp=sharing),
a [more detailed one](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ypONXF9mDQCF5lwWJmh5qIlvkGRBtAW8zupJt7juPxQ/edit?usp=sharing) with some code, and
a [detailed walkthrough](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-cAMxt7CmLMxYLiy3ehwWjKNabUQSgUoh-1C9Oaaq1g/edit?usp=sharing) with lots of code.

And resources from outside of the team:

- Installing OpenCV 3.2.0 [instructions](https://milq.github.io/install-opencv-ubuntu-debian/).

- Official OpenCV 3.1.0 [JavaDocs](http://docs.opencv.org/java/3.1.0/).

- Official OpenCV 2.4 [documentation](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/index.html).
  Although it's not the latest version, these docs are filled with interesting
  and approachable examples.

- A Team 195 [talk](https://youtu.be/bsuZq1mvwio) (includes useful tips about
  off-roboRIO CV, overview of CV from basic principles, and realtime
  sensor reading for motion control).

- Talks by Team 254: [Integrating Computer Vision with Motion Control](https://www.team254.com/documents/vision-control/)
