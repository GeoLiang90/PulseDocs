# Index of CV resources

In addition to the documentation here on MkDocs, we have:

- [Team694/stuyvision-lib](https://github.com/Team694/stuyvision-lib),
  an in-house GUI to help with tuning.

- [Team694/cv-edu-2017](https://github.com/Team694/cv-edu-2017), an example
  of a project using this library for simple vision processing.

- a few presentations by our members:
a [high-level talk](https://docs.google.com/a/stuypulse.com/presentation/d/1KvPWpPO9rFjTZ3nKJy4rmbvxRiOo2EwrciE0fggv8xM/edit?usp=sharing),
a [more detailed one](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ypONXF9mDQCF5lwWJmh5qIlvkGRBtAW8zupJt7juPxQ/edit?usp=sharing) with some code, and
a [detailed walkthrough](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-cAMxt7CmLMxYLiy3ehwWjKNabUQSgUoh-1C9Oaaq1g/edit?usp=sharing) with lots of code.

And resources from outside of the team:

- Official OpenCV 3.1.0 [JavaDocs](http://docs.opencv.org/java/3.1.0/).

- Official OpenCV 2.4 [documentation](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/index.html).
  Although it's not the latest version, these docs are filled with interesting
  and approachable examples.

- A Team 195 [talk](https://youtu.be/bsuZq1mvwio) (includes useful tips about
  off-roboRIO CV, overview of CV from basic principles, and realtime
  sensor reading for motion control).

- Talks by Team 254: [Integrating Computer Vision with Motion Control](https://www.team254.com/documents/vision-control/)
  and [Motion Planning & Control in FRC](https://youtu.be/8319J1BEHwM).
