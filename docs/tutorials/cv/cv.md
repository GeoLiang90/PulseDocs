_Let your robot see!_

Computer Vision (CV) can be as essential asset in the right game. In 2016 (Stronghold), CV was essential to our robot's functioning, with our robot able to see the goalpost, and use its position in the frame to align, scoring the boulders with very high accuracy, something which we used in TeleOp as well, much more efficient than our drive team.
